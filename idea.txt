Project Outline: Machine Learning for Airfoil L/D Prediction and Optimization
1. Introduction & Motivation
Short overview: Why accurate prediction of lift-to-drag ratio ($L/D$) is critical (aerodynamics, motorsport, aerospace).

Problem statement: Using AI/ML to create fast, high-quality $L/D$ predictors from CFD data (AirfRANS).

Goal: Systematically evaluate classical ML, ensemble, and deep learning methods—then use the best predictor for design optimization.

2. Dataset & Feature Engineering
Dataset: AirfRANS—NACA airfoils, $Re = 2-6$ million, $\alpha = -5^\circ$ to $+15^\circ$.

Features: Airfoil geometry parameters (NACA, thickness, camber, position...), AoA, Reynolds number.

Targets: $L/D$ ratio (calculated as $C_l/C_d$ from sim outputs).

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions, correlation matrices, check for outliers/missing data, principal component plots if relevant.

3. Model Comparison: Methods and Analysis
For each, report training/validation R², MAE/RMSE, bias-variance/cross-validation diagnostics, feature importances (where applicable):

Model Type	Key Experiments/Comparisons
Linear regression	Baseline, interpret coefficients, show limitations
Polynomial regression	Nonlinearity trade-off, show overfitting at high degrees
Ridge/LASSO/Elastic Net	Show regularization curves, coefficients shrink/sparsify
Decision Tree	Visualize splits, feature importance, show overfitting risk
Random Forest	Bagging, stable/robust, feature importance, OOB error
Gradient Boosting/XGBoost	Hyperparameter tuning, high accuracy, performance curves
Neural Net (shallow/deep)	Vary architectures, optimizer, report best deep MLP results
Deep Ensemble	Average outputs of NN/tree models, best accuracy/uncertainty
Hyperparameter tuning: For each model (regularization strength, tree depth, learning rate, etc.), report how choices affect performance/overfitting.

Cross-validation: Use K-fold for robust error estimates.

Regularization path: Show how L1/L2 affect model coefficients/features (with plots if possible).

Feature importance/interpretation: For tree/ensembles, and for LASSO/Ridge.

4. Comparative Results & Data-Driven Insights
Table & Plots: RMSE, MAE, R², for test data—all models side by side.

Error analysis: Show where each method struggles/succeeds (e.g., high AoA, rare geometry).

Bias-variance diagnostics: Which models overfit/underfit? Why?

Deductive insights: Which geometric features matter most for L/D? Do ensemble/deep models agree with regularized linear models?

Findings: Deep ensemble or deep MLP delivers best accuracy for L/D prediction, but ensemble trees are close; regularization improves interpretability but can trade off slight accuracy.

5. Bonus: Optimization Using Best Model
Setup: Use GA (or other optimizer) with the best surrogate as the fitness function.

Goal: Maximize L/D under physically reasonable geometry/AoA/Re constraints.

Showcase: Optimized airfoil shape/parameters, compare predicted L/D to NACA 0012 baseline under set conditions.

Impact: Quantify improvement (“Optimized airfoil achieves 22% higher L/D vs baseline at Re = ... and AoA = ...”).

Conclusion: Close the “engineering loop”: how modern ML can directly drive better design.

6. Discussion & Conclusions
Reflect on: Method strengths/weaknesses, practical trade-offs, insights from feature importance and regularization.

Highlight: Lessons about model complexity, interpretability, and value for engineering decision-making.

Propose: Next directions (larger datasets, PINNs, direct flow field learning, transfer to UniFoil, etc.).
