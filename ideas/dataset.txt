Using the PALMO Dataset for Airfoil Lift-to-Drag Ratio Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach
Executive Summary
This project develops a machine learning surrogate model to predict the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio of NACA 4-series airfoils using the PALMO (OVERFLOW Machine Learning Airfoil Performance) database. By training on 12 NACA 4-series airfoils and testing on 4 "unseen" airfoils (e.g., NACA 3415), we demonstrate that a simple, interpretable model based on geometric parameters can achieve accuracy comparable to complex neural networks for rapid airfoil screening in conceptual design. This approach emphasizes academic rigor through high-fidelity CFD data, physically meaningful features, and industry-standard validation methodology.

1. Introduction
1.1 Project Motivation
Predicting aerodynamic performance (lift-to-drag ratio, L/D) is critical in aerospace design, but high-fidelity CFD simulations are computationally expensive—taking hours or days per airfoil. Machine learning surrogates offer a solution: train once on CFD data, then predict performance in milliseconds, enabling rapid exploration of thousands of candidate airfoils during conceptual design.​

1.2 Project Objective
This project aims to:

Train a machine learning model to predict L/D = f(geometry, Mach, Re, α) for 2D NACA 4-series airfoils.​

Use physically meaningful geometric parameters (thickness, camber, camber position) as inputs, rather than raw coordinates, to match industry practice.​

Validate on unseen airfoils (NACA 3415, etc.) to demonstrate generalization capability.​

Compare our model to the published PALMO surrogate to assess trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy.​

1.3 Why This Matters for an AI Course
This project demonstrates:

Academic rigor: Using real NASA CFD data, not synthetic or toy datasets.​

Domain knowledge integration: Leveraging aerospace engineering principles (NACA parameterization) in feature engineering.​

Practical ML: Training on some airfoils, testing on others—exactly how ML is validated in industry.​

Analysis depth: Error analysis by Mach, Re, α, thickness, camber; comparison to baseline models.​

2. Dataset: PALMO (OVERFLOW Machine Learning Airfoil Performance Database)
2.1 What is PALMO?
PALMO is a publicly available airfoil performance database created by NASA's Rotorcraft Systems Engineering and Simulation Center using the OVERFLOW CFD solver. It contains high-fidelity RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations with Spalart-Allmaras turbulence modeling for 16 NACA 4-series airfoils across a wide range of flight conditions.​

Key features:

Solver: OVERFLOW 2.3 (structured overset-grid RANS with SA turbulence model).​

Airfoils: 16 NACA 4-series (0006 to 4424).​

Conditions per airfoil: 10 Mach × 8 Re × 41 α = 3,280 simulations.​

Total data points: 16 × 3,280 = 52,480 simulations.​

Output: Lift coefficient (c_l), drag coefficient (c_d), pitching moment (c_m) for each condition.​

2.2 Why PALMO is Ideal for This Project
Criterion	PALMO	Alternatives (e.g., XFOIL-based datasets)
Physics fidelity	High-fidelity RANS CFD with full viscous effects, shocks, transonic flows ​	Low-fidelity panel+integral boundary layer; no shocks ​
Reynolds number range	75k–8M (covers UAVs to full-scale aircraft) ​	Typically 100k–1M (limited to low-speed flows) ​
Mach number range	0.25–0.90 (subsonic to transonic) ​	Incompressible only (Mach ≈ 0.1) ​
Dataset size	52,480 simulations ​	90,000–100,000 simulations (but lower fidelity) ​
Industry relevance	Used in rotorcraft and fixed-wing design ​	Used for conceptual screening ​
Preprocessing complexity	Very low: NACA names → thickness/camber/camber_pos ​	Moderate: parse coordinates, compute geometric features ​
Verdict: PALMO offers the best balance of high fidelity, large size, and ease of use for an AI course project that aims to impress with academic rigor.​

2.3 Dataset Structure
Each simulation in PALMO is characterized by:

Inputs:

Conditions grid:

Mach: 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90 (10 values)​

Alpha: –20° to +20° in 1° increments (41 values)​

2.4 The 16 "Base Cubes" (Airfoils in PALMO)
PALMO contains 16 NACA 4-series airfoils, split into training and test sets for surrogate validation:​

Training airfoils (12 "base cubes"):

NACA 0006, 0012, 0018, 0024 (symmetric, thickness 6–24%)

NACA 2406, 2412, 2418, 2424 (camber 2%, thickness 6–24%)

NACA 4406, 4412, 4418, 4424 (camber 4%, thickness 6–24%)

Test airfoils (4 "off-axis cubes"):

NACA 3415, 3418, 4415, 4421 (intermediate camber/thickness)

These test airfoils were intentionally omitted from the training set to validate the surrogate's ability to interpolate within the (camber, thickness) design space.​

2.5 Geometric Parameterization: NACA 4-Digit System
The NACA 4-digit system encodes airfoil geometry in four digits: MPTT:​

M (1st digit): Maximum camber as % of chord (e.g., 2 → 2%)

P (2nd digit): Position of max camber in tenths of chord (e.g., 4 → 40%)

TT (last 2 digits): Maximum thickness as % of chord (e.g., 12 → 12%)

Example: NACA 2412

Camber = 2% of chord

Camber position = 40% of chord

Thickness = 12% of chord

For NACA 3415 (test airfoil):

Camber = 3% (0.03)

Camber position = 40% (0.4)

Thickness = 15% (0.15)

This compact representation is standard in aerospace and directly usable as ML input.​

3. Input Features and Target Variable
3.1 Input Features (6 total)
Our model takes the following inputs, matching industry practice for airfoil performance prediction:​

Geometric parameters (3):

camber (c): Maximum camber / chord (0.00–0.04 for PALMO)

camber_pos (p): Position of maximum camber / chord (0.4 for all NACA 4-series in PALMO)

thickness (t): Maximum thickness / chord (0.06–0.24 for PALMO)

Flow conditions (3):
4. Mach (M): Mach number (0.25–0.90)
5. Re: Reynolds number (75,000–8,000,000)
6. alpha (α): Angle of attack in degrees (–20° to +20°)

Rationale: This representation is:

Compact: 6 features vs. 100–200 coordinate points

Interpretable: Each feature has clear physical meaning

Industry-standard: Matches how engineers describe airfoils in conceptual design​

Enables analysis: Easy to plot L/D vs. thickness, camber, α, etc.

3.2 Target Variable: L/D Ratio
We predict the lift-to-drag ratio:

L/D
=
c
l
c
d
L/D= 
c 
d
 
c 
l
 
 
Why L/D?

It is the primary metric for aerodynamic efficiency (higher L/D = better performance).​

It directly drives aircraft range, endurance, and fuel efficiency.​

It is more meaningful than predicting 
c
l
c 
l
  and 
c
d
c 
d
  separately for conceptual design.​

Data cleaning: We filter out:

Cases where 
c
d
<
0.0001
c 
d
 <0.0001 (to avoid division by zero)

Cases where the CFD did not converge (if marked in the dataset)

4. Methodology
4.1 Train/Test Split Strategy
We follow the airfoil-based split used in the PALMO paper:​

Training set: 12 NACA 4-series airfoils (all conditions)

NACA 0006, 0012, 0018, 0024

NACA 2406, 2412, 2418, 2424

NACA 4406, 4412, 4418, 4424

Total: 12 × 3,280 = 39,360 training samples

Test set: 4 NACA 4-series airfoils (all conditions)

NACA 3415, 3418, 4415, 4421

Total: 4 × 3,280 = 13,120 test samples

This is a true generalization test: the model has never seen these 4 airfoil geometries during training.​

4.2 Model Architecture
We will train and compare:

Baseline: Linear Regression

Simple linear model to establish a baseline

Random Forest Regressor

Non-linear, interpretable, good for small feature sets

Hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split

MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)

Shallow neural network (e.g., 2–3 hidden layers)

Architecture: 6 → 64 → 32 → 1

Activation: ReLU; Optimizer: Adam; Loss: MSE

Justification: We prioritize simplicity and interpretability over complexity, as this is a course project and we want to analyze feature importance.​

4.3 Training Procedure
Data normalization:

Standardize features:

Log-transform Reynolds number:

Train/validation split:

Split training set (39,360 samples) into 80% train / 20% validation

Hyperparameter tuning:

Grid search or random search on validation set

Final evaluation:

Retrain on full training set with best hyperparameters

Evaluate on test set (4 unseen airfoils)

4.4 Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average |predicted – true| L/D

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Average |(predicted – true) / true| × 100%

R² Score: Coefficient of determination (1.0 = perfect fit)

Maximum L/D error: Error at the most important operating point (maximum L/D)​

Target performance: The PALMO neural-network surrogate achieves ~2.1% error in rotor performance metrics. We aim for <5% MAPE on maximum L/D for unseen airfoils.​

5. Expected Results and Analysis
5.1 Quantitative Validation
We will generate:

Scatter plot: Predicted vs. true L/D on test airfoils

Error histogram: Distribution of prediction errors

Per-airfoil error: MAPE for each of the 4 test airfoils

5.2 Sensitivity Analysis
To demonstrate understanding of the physics, we will plot:

L/D vs. thickness at fixed (Mach, Re, α, camber)

L/D vs. camber at fixed (Mach, Re, α, thickness)

L/D vs. α at fixed (Mach, Re, thickness, camber)

L/D vs. Mach at fixed (Re, α, thickness, camber)

Expected trends:

L/D increases with α up to stall, then drops​

Thinner airfoils have lower drag but lower max lift​

Camber increases lift and L/D at low α, but increases drag at high α​

L/D drops sharply near transonic Mach due to wave drag​

If the model captures these trends, it demonstrates physics consistency.

5.3 Feature Importance
For Random Forest, we will extract feature importance scores to answer:

Which features most influence L/D predictions?

Expected: α, Mach, thickness should be most important

5.4 Comparison to PALMO Surrogate
We will compare our results to the published PALMO surrogate:​

Metric	PALMO Neural Network ​	Our Model (Expected)
Architecture	Multi-layer NN with ~1000s parameters	MLP/RF with <10k parameters
Test error (max L/D)	~2.1% in rotor performance	Target: <5% MAPE
Training time	Hours on GPU	Minutes on CPU
Interpretability	Low (black box)	High (feature importance, small model)
Discussion: Our model sacrifices some accuracy for simplicity and interpretability, which is appropriate for conceptual design screening.​

6. Limitations and Assumptions
6.1 Dataset Limitations
1. Limited to NACA 4-series airfoils

PALMO only covers NACA 4-digit airfoils with thickness 6–24%, camber 0–4%, camber position fixed at 40%.​

Cannot generalize to:

NACA 6-series, supercritical, or custom airfoils

Airfoils with camber position ≠ 40%

Extreme thickness (<6% or >24%) or camber (>4%)

Impact: Model is only useful for NACA 4-series within the training range. For other airfoils, CFD or a different dataset is needed.

2. 2D airfoils only

PALMO is 2D; it does not account for 3D wing effects (sweep, taper, wingtip vortices, spanwise flow).​

Impact: Predictions cannot be directly applied to 3D wings. A 2D-to-3D correction (e.g., lift-line theory, 3D CFD) is required for real aircraft design.

3. No surface roughness or ice accretion

PALMO assumes smooth, clean airfoils.​

Impact: Real-world airfoils with surface roughness, ice, or manufacturing defects will have higher drag and lower L/D than predicted.

4. Fixed turbulence model

PALMO uses only the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.​

Impact: Results may differ slightly from CFD with other turbulence models (k-ε, k-ω SST, etc.) or LES/DNS.

5. Discrete Mach, Re, α grid

PALMO has 10 Mach × 8 Re × 41 α values, not continuous.​

Impact: The model must interpolate between grid points. Accuracy may degrade for conditions far from the training grid (e.g., Mach = 0.27, Re = 350k).

6.2 Model Limitations
1. Interpolation, not extrapolation

The ML model can only interpolate within the training range.​

Cannot predict for:

Airfoils outside the camber/thickness range (e.g., NACA 6412, NACA 0030)

Mach > 0.90, Mach < 0.25

Re > 8M, Re < 75k

α > 20°, α < –20°

Impact: For conditions outside the training range, the model will likely give unreliable predictions.

2. No uncertainty quantification

Simple ML models (MLP, RF) do not provide confidence intervals or prediction uncertainty.​

Impact: We cannot tell if a prediction is reliable or not. For safety-critical design, a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian Process, Bayesian NN) would be better.

3. Assumes input features are independent

In reality, Mach, Re, and α are often coupled in flight (e.g., high Mach → high Re).​

Impact: The model may not capture subtle interactions between features if they are always seen together in training data.

4. No flow-field prediction

The model only predicts L/D (a scalar), not pressure distributions, velocity fields, or separation locations.​

Impact: It cannot be used for detailed design tasks (e.g., designing flap geometry, predicting stall behavior).

6.3 Computational and Practical Limitations
1. Data availability

PALMO Version 1.0 has only 16 airfoils. Future versions may include more geometries, but for now, the training set is small relative to the full NACA 4-series family (hundreds of possible combinations).​

Impact: The model's generalization is limited to interpolation within a sparse design space.

2. Training data quality

PALMO is based on RANS CFD, which has known limitations (e.g., struggles with massive separation, transition prediction).​

Impact: The ML model inherits the errors of the CFD solver. If OVERFLOW underpredicts drag at stall, the ML model will too.

3. No dynamic or unsteady effects

PALMO contains only steady-state simulations.​

Impact: Cannot predict dynamic stall, flutter, or time-varying loads (e.g., gusts, turbulence).

4. Compressibility effects at high Mach

At Mach > 0.7, shock waves and wave drag dominate. The ML model may struggle to capture the sharp nonlinearities near the transonic drag rise.​

Impact: Predictions at Mach > 0.8 should be validated carefully against CFD.

6.4 Project Scope Limitations
1. Single-point prediction only

This project predicts L/D at a single (Mach, Re, α) condition at a time.

Impact: For design optimization (which requires evaluating thousands of conditions), we need to call the model thousands of times. This is still fast (<1 ms per call), but post-processing may be needed to extract useful metrics (e.g., maximum L/D across all α).

2. No optimization or inverse design

The project trains a forward model: geometry → L/D.

Impact: We cannot directly answer "What airfoil gives maximum L/D at Mach 0.7, Re 2M?" without brute-force search. Inverse design or optimization (e.g., genetic algorithm, gradient-based) is a separate project.

3. Limited time for hyperparameter tuning

As a course project with limited time, we may not exhaustively tune hyperparameters.

Impact: The model may not achieve the lowest possible error. A production model would require more tuning and cross-validation.

7. Practical Applications in Industry
Despite limitations, this project demonstrates a real aerospace ML workflow:

1. Rapid airfoil screening

Evaluate L/D for 1,000 NACA 4-series airfoils (varying thickness, camber) at a given (Mach, Re, α) in <1 second.​

Compare to CFD: 1,000 × 30 minutes = 500 CPU-hours.

2. Surrogate for design optimization

Use the ML model as a fitness function in a genetic algorithm or Bayesian optimization loop.​

Example: "Find the NACA 4-series airfoil that maximizes L/D at cruise (Mach 0.7, Re 5M, α 2°)."

3. Polar table generation

Generate a full polar (L/D vs. α) for a given airfoil at a single (Mach, Re) in <1 second.​

Compare to CFD: 30–60 minutes per polar.

4. Early-stage trade studies

Quickly assess how thickness, camber, and camber position affect L/D across the flight envelope.​

Real-world analogy: The PALMO paper shows that the surrogate can replace CFD in a rotor performance model with only ~2.1% error, reducing a 3D rotor simulation from hours to seconds.​
